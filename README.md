# Item Scroller

Allows you to switch items using the scroll wheel

You can do so unless you are climbing, rope climbing, spectating and the item you are holding does not have a scroll function

If the item you are holding has a scroll function (example the GuideBook) it will be skipped and you will have to manually select it with the number keys

This is kinda annoying but i will maybe make an update in the future to fix this

## Config
You can modify the minimum amount of scroll required before switching items with the config option `ScrollThreshold` , keep in mind thats its done so every frame so setting it to high might make it impossible to use it (I would advie to keep it under 1.5 but its different for each mouse)

## Know issues
other than the aformentioned issue with the GuideBook the only other issue that i am aware of is a few errors being found in the console when you scroll to fast but i dont think it does anything and also some free spinning mouses to not be able to scroll properly cuz of how fast they can be
